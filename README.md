Aim: Reinforcement Learning in the financial applications

### Assignments

1. Consider the discrete-time asset allocation example in section 8.4 of Rao and Jelvis.  Suppose the single-time-step return of the risky asset from time t to t+1 as Y_t=a, prob=p,  and b, prob=(1−p) .  Suppose that T =10, use the TD method to find the Q function, and hence the optimal strategy.
