We finish the option hedging which the underlying stock follows binomial and GBM in both European option and American option.

For binomial stock, we use DDPG to find the optimal action and compare with the true delta of the option.

For GBM stock, we use DDPG and SAC to find the optimal action and compare with the true delta of the option.

In addition, we analyze the time when exercising early in the American put option for both binomial stock and GBM stock.
